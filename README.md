# Regex Grimoire

This repository houses a variety of regex formulas I've found useful at one
point or another (for alteration, conjuration, or other forms of computational black magic). 

The `regexes` folder contains subfolders, divided by category,
that contain source vimscript files for executing the regex. Each subfolder has a corresponding markdown
file, stored at the top level, that describes the regex formulae it contains.

## The TARGET Variable

Many of the dark invocations inscribed herein contain a `TARGET` variable.
Replace instances of this variable with the name of whatever pattern demon
you're trying to conjure. Of course, some of the formulae themselves (if they
are terminal, that is, do not contain a `TARGET`) are fine candidates for
`TARGET` replacements.
